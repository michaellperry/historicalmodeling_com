[Work Item Tracker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2009-10-07-work-item-tracker.markdown %})

To see if a ProjectName has been replaced, we define a query:

```
fact ProjectName
{
   Project project;
   ProjectName* prior;
   string name;

   bool replaced { not exists ProjectName next : next.prior = this }
}
```

Replaced is false until another ProjectName is created. Then it becomes true.

We can use this to see what the current project name is. We define another query:

```
Project
{
   unique;

   ProjectName* name { ProjectName n : n.project = this where not n.replaced }
}
```

This query will give us just the leaves of the fact tree. If this query returns no ProjectNames, the Project hasnâ€™t been named yet. If it returns one, then that is the current name. If it returns more than one, then there is a conflict.
