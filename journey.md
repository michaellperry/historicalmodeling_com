Hi, my name is Jan.  I'm a developer from Belgium who is, maybe just like you, looking for solutions that really work in the area of mobile applications.

For a while now I have been fascinated by Michael's promising concept of Historical Modeling. I promised Michael to write a series of articles, which will be published on this blog over the next couple of months. In this series you can follow me on my journey discovering how to make good use of Historical Modeling in order to serve customers needs more efficiently.
